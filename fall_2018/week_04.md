Last Week's Accomplishments
===========================
* Talked to IED shop professor for some validation and verification on how to make the "box" that encapsulates the wiring and microchips
* Identified the best process to go about with the project (i.e. initial sketch, finalized sketch, CAD model, 3D printed prototype)

This Week's Plan
================
* Leaning towards 3D printing a prototype first, and then discussing how to make the actual sturdy model
* Ask for constructive criticism from my team/outside sources on my current model and what I can improve on
* Considering making a latch that one may open for easy-access maintenance in the event of chip/wiring/connection failure

Anything Blocking?
==================
* installation in the buildings, who would install it and how (more of a future issue)
* still verifying best material to build the "box", leaning towards ABS plastic for being cheap, yet strong
