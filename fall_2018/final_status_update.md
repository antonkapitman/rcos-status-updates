FINAL STATUS UPDATE
===================

My job within the ADC group (Automatic Door Control) was to design and manufacture a box that would house the circuitry that programmed the door to open. My primary dimensions were obtained from my team members who worked on the designing of the PCB (Printed Circuit Board), which is estimated to be about 4in by 1in. Using Nx 11, I designed a box that is 5in by 2 in by 1in overall, with a thickness of 0.25in, as well as 4 drill holes to fasten it to the wall.

The material used would be a type of wood due to its light and cheap nature; the process used to manufacture such a box would be laser cutting the wood, as it is a very cheap and quick process. I made sure to conduct research and be certain that wood allows a good Bluetooth connection between the user's phone and the Raspberry Pi that my team used. The finalized box also has a hole on the side of it to allow for a wiring connection between the PCB and the power supply.

Though I do have a finalized/close to a final design made, I have not manufactured the box as it heavily relies on the dimensions of the PCB which has not been built yet and may still undergo changes. It is important to have the final design of the PCB so as to not waste time and money on multiple box designs. 

All of my designs/updates are recorded within the "fall 2018" branch of the "rcos-status-updates" repository.
