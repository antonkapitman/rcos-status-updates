Last Week's Accomplishments
===========================
Sent out survey to the main disabilities person with questions like:
-----------------------------------------------------
* which buildings are most popular
* who will have access to the program and for how long

Researched which materials are best to use for encapsulating the electronics:
-------------------------------------------------
* Many materials can block signals or highly weaken them
* Wood, synthetics (plastic), or glass are the best
* Metals, plaster, concrete the worst for signal transmission



This Week's Plan
================
* Draft up a CAD model to surround the controller
* Identify how to make the box (probably 3D printing)

Anything Blocking?
==================
* cost of the printing
* not sure how many pieces may be included inside the box
