Last Week's Accomplishments
===========================
* Continuing to ask the guys who work at the Forge for any suggestions/critiques
* Have determined that laser cutting a box will be the cheapest and fastest way, while including enough structural integrity

This Week's Plan
================
* Ask for suggestions on improving the model
* Continue updating CAD model
* Starting to get more dimensions from the electrical guys, so the model is getting much more accurate to what it will be

Anything Blocking?
==================
* installation in the buildings, who would install it and how (more of a future issue)
* Need more exact dimensions for an accurate model
* Material needed
* Lots of exams coming up, not that much time devoted the past week
