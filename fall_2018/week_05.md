Last Week's Accomplishments
===========================
* Continuing sketching a CAD model of the "wirebox"
* Made improvements to the model, drilling small diameter holes in which to screw the box, instead of having attached rods

This Week's Plan
================
* Ask for suggestions on improving the model
* Design a latch for quick access, probably with a lock

Anything Blocking?
==================
* installation in the buildings, who would install it and how (more of a future issue)
* Need more exact dimensions for an accurate model
