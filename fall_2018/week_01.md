Last Week's Accomplishments
===========================
* Discussed possible micro controllers
* Identified that we can switch from Raspberry Pi to an Arduino controller, which is far cheaper ($8)
* Still thinking about how to utilize Wifi or Bluetooth to open doors

This Week's Plan
================
* Go further in detail on the specs of the controller
* Brainstorm possible ideas that we can expand our project on (i.e. gps, favorite locations)

Anything Blocking?
==================
* Identified that cost is a problem
* Connecting to the school Wifi is problematic so far
